"""DataUpdateCoordinator for the DHL carrier.

The config entry holds a snapshot of the cookiejar (CONF_COOKIES) plus a
stable device_id/device_name pair. The coordinator restores those cookies
into its own DhlApi instance at setup and calls refresh_session() every
poll.

SESSION LIFETIME, measured 2026-09-04 — read this before changing the poll
interval. The DHL session is a 30-minute token carried in the
access-token/access-signature cookie pair, and /auth/refresh authenticates
with that pair. Until 2026-09-04 the minted token was never written back
into the jar, so the pair kept the login-time token and the session died 30
minutes after the SMS, whichever way we polled: both entries' modified_at
stayed pinned to the login instant, the stored token's exp sat at login+30,
and the server's 401 named that exact timestamp. api_dhl._adopt_access_token
is what fixes it. Consequence: THE POLL INTERVAL IS ALSO THE KEEPALIVE. Poll
less often than every 30 minutes and the session expires between polls and
asks for an SMS, so the interval is clamped below (DHL_MAX_INTERVAL).

The jar is persisted back to entry.data whenever it changes — now genuinely
every poll, since the token rotates. That write is only safe because
_async_reload_on_update (__init__.py) reloads on options changes only —
without that guard this would reload the integration every poll, the same
storm DPD and Pocztex each hit once.

RESIDUAL, known and accepted: the first refresh of a setup runs while the
entry is still SETUP_IN_PROGRESS, and persisting from there is what left
DPD's coordinator empty until a reload (see coordinator_dpd.py). So that one
jar is not written, and a restart inside the first poll interval after a
reauth restores the login-time jar — which is fine as long as it is younger
than 30 minutes, and it always is at that point.
