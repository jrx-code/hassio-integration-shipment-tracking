"""Carrier logos: a static HTTP path plus the ``entity_picture`` URL per carrier.

Home Assistant has exactly ONE brand image per integration domain — the device
registry carries no icon or picture field (checked live on 2026-09-01: a device
entry has ``manufacturer``/``model``/``hw_version``… and nothing image-shaped),
and the frontend fetches ``/api/brands/integration/<domain>/icon.png``, keyed by
domain. So every carrier device under this hub shows the same parcel box, and no
device-level setting can change that.

What CAN differ per carrier is the entity: ``entity_picture`` replaces the icon
wherever an entity is drawn. That is what this module feeds — a real PNG per
carrier, served from the integration's own folder.

The pictures are round-safe: the frontend draws ``entity_picture`` as a circle
with ``background-size: cover``, so each file is a 256² badge in the carrier's
own colours with the mark inscribed in the circle. Built by
``scripts/build_badge_logos.py`` in the panel repo; sources are the carriers'
own press materials.

The static path is public — no auth, like any other frontend asset. These are
logos, nothing account-specific: the QR codes, which ARE account-specific, keep
going through the ``image`` platform with its signed paths.
