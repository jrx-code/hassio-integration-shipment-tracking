"""Group ready parcels into pickup groups (multiskrytka-aware).

A *multiskrytka* (multiCompartment) is several parcels the courier stacked
together; the InPost app collects them with one action, so we represent the whole
group by ONE QR — the group *leader*. Verified against the live mobile API
(2026-08-03): every parcel, including multi-compartment members, carries its own
``openCode``/``qrCode`` (``P|+48<phone>|<code>``); the members share
``multiCompartment.uuid`` and exactly one member (the leader) carries the full
``shipmentNumbers`` list — surfaced here as ``multi_count`` being set.

The physical "does the leader QR open every locker" behaviour could NOT be
verified (no live ready multiskrytka at design time), so every member's own code
is kept as a fallback (``member_codes``).

Pure/stdlib only — unit-testable without Home Assistant.
