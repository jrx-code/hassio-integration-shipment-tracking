"""App-to-app sharing: peer discovery and pick-what-to-share logic (InPost only).

Pure functions here, no Home Assistant imports beyond config-entry typing, so the
selection rules stay unit-testable. The InPost side is described in api.py;
the short version: a share is a POST of (shipmentNumber, friendUuid) pairs, and
it shows up on the recipient's account as a normal parcel with
ownershipStatus=FRIEND carrying openCode/qrCode.

Sharing is InPost-specific (DPD has no equivalent API). Every lookup below is
scoped to CARRIER_INPOST entries, even though DOMAIN is shared with DPD under
the multi-carrier umbrella — otherwise a DPD account with the same phone number
(same person, two apps) would be picked up as an InPost peer/alias by mistake.
